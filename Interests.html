                <h2>Tennis</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have been playing tennis for 2 years, and I have been rapidly improving over the 2 years, I went from a flat-out beginner to number 58
                        in the state and <strong>top 1500</strong> in the <b>country.</b> Currently, I am injured in my right wrist so I am unable to play any tournaments right now.
                        Aside from that, I also like to watch live tennis and teenis highlights on Tennis Channel, and I usually watch the grand slam tournaments. My favorite tennis player at the moment is Jannik sinner, Alexander bublik, and Jack draper.
                        One career tennis milestone for me is when I won the 2024 Regional Rockland County Junior Tennis Championships (RRCJTC'24) to claim my first tennis title, and to boost myself up in my tennis career. It was a tournament no just for the <i>glory</i>
                        ,but also for the confidence. Another micelleanous fact about me is that when I visited the US Open back in August, I was able to be lucky enough to take 6 pictures with famous tennis players. (Dont worry I have a list of the players' names at the bottom of the page)

                            <h2>Coding</h2>
                        <p>Another hobby that I treasure is coding, I love to code front-end web development because I like to see how a website is made, and I like to code out functions of a website. In my free time, I would go on youtube to look at 3 hour coding tutorials of how to make a webpage
                            and I was able to make my own history webpage. (<strong>Though it did take around 7 hours, it was worth it.</strong>). However, coding is a big topic, so there are many ways of how people can interpret the word "coding." So to clarify, front-end coding is what I enjoy doing,
                            however back-end development is one of my interests in the future because it is all the gears, nuts, bolts to a fully-functioning webpage. Also, once I master web development, i want to be able to make an app or be able to do AI development or data science. To elaborate on 
                            coding, it also gives me a new set of friends that I could be exposed <i>to</i> as well.
