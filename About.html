    <h2><strong><b><i>Background</i></b></strong></h2>
    <p>My name is <strong><i><b>Nate Johns</b></i></strong>, I was born on February 14 in Kanagawa, Japan (right before the huge tsunami) and I currently am living in Bergen County. My Ethnic background is an Asian-Finnish american. 
        Right now, I am currently a student at Bergen Tech Teterboro in my freshman year. I am studying 
        computer science at Bergen Tech. Coding and web development has been a ongoing hobby I treasure and enjoy in my free time. So I chose to go the CS route in Bergen Tech. Skills 
        I am currently learning at the moment is css, javascript, and python, so I can create a fully functioning website. My BCTS pathway right now is doing HTML, CSS, and Javascript freshman year as front-end developing. Then in sophomore year to senior year, it will consist of front end development and app development.
        My career goals is to do a <i>CS</i> major at <i>Georgia Tech</i> and become a data or <strong>AI scientist for Google.</strong> If you guys want to learn more about my interests and hobbies, then check out my <a href="Interests.html">Interests and Hobbies.</a> page.
